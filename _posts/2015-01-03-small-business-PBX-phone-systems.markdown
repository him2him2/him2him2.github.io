Small business PBX phone systems today are increasingly more sophisticated. Here's a quick comparison of a conventional small business PBX system and a Unified Communications system that combines an Internet Protocol (IP) PBX and other features.

A Conventional Small Business PBX

Traditionally, a small business PBX (Private Branch Exchange) is a telephone switching system that manages incoming and outgoing calls for a company's internal users. A PBX is connected to the public phone system and automatically routes incoming calls to specific extensions. It also shares and manages multiple lines. A typical small business PBX system includes external and internal phone lines; a computer server that manages call switching and routing; and a console for manual control.

IP-Based Small Business PBX

An IP PBX can do everything a traditional small business PBX can do and more. It performs the switching and connecting of Voice over IP as well as landline calls.

A conventional PBX requires two networks, one for data and another for voice. An IP PBX system runs on an IP data network, which saves costs and minimizes network management.

You can use IP phones, softphones (which don't require any phone hardware beyond a computer and a microphone headset), and landline phones on an IP PBX phone system.

Unified Communications: IP PBX and More

Small businesses require specialized features to support their particular workflows. Unified Communications Manager Express from Cisco Systems is designed specifically for small businesses. It combines an IP PBX with robust telephony features that traditional phone systems can't deliver.
